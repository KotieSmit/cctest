Codeception Testing
===================
We are never too senior or too old to learn new ways of doing things.  Just because you did something a certain way,
does not make it the best and only way (or the right one).

When I started doing QA, I was completely lost.  Followed some examples here and there and eventually got some tests 
running and expanded my knowledge from there.

Quite recently it was decided/prefered that my tests have to move to PHP (from RoR with Rspec and Watir). 
So I found myself lost again...  I tried following samples, but (yes they did work... locally) none of them 
explained how to setup from start to end.... code sample, Selenium setup, and even Jenkins CI integration.
